# Bigmart-Sales-Data-Prediction
In this model, a five-step procedure is used to solve the problem of predicting the Sales revenue for different products at different outlet locations for Big Mart Companies. First, the data is acquired, collected and divided into training and test label. This data undergoes a preliminary analysis which includes univariate and bivariate analysis. In the second stage, data pre-processing is performed which takes care of missing and erroneous values in the dataset. In the third stage, the features are selected and modified to get the best results. In the fourth stage, feature transformation is used to convert categorical features to numerical features. In the 10 fifth stage, using various algorithm techniques models are built and the results are evaluated. These results are communicated to the firm and finally, after approval the results are applied by the firm to generate a business model for next year. Using this method guarantees more accurate and better results.
